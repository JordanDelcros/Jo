# Javascript Overloaded (beta 1) 

Jo is a JavaScript framework to make the same as pure JS with less code.

## How to use ?
Like every JavaScript library, simply link the JS file into an HTML `<head>` or `<body>` tag.
`<script type="text/javascript src="path/to/jo.js></script>`

Now you can use `Jo` or `$` like that `$("section")` to get the nodes from the DOM.

Then you can use methods like this one `$("section").css("background-color", "#456DA0");`.

## Documentation
like the script itself, the [documentation](https://jordandelcros.github.io/Jo/) is under construction.

## Todo
- offline application
- WebSQL database -> window.openDatabase()
- geolocation
- localStorage SessionStorage
- complex object model Object.defineProperty
- copy/cut/paste
