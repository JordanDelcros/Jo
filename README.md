# Javascript overloaded (beta 1) 

Jo is a Javascript library to make the same as pure JS with less code.

## How to use ?
Like every Javascript library, link Jo.js file into your HTML head or body end
`<script type="text/javascript src="path/to/Jo.js></script>`

Now you can use `Jo` or `$` like this `$("body > section:first-child")` to get nodes.

Then you can use methods like `$("body > section:first-child").css("background-color", "#FF00FF")`.
